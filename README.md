# Weather App

This project took me deep into learning promises, only to be introduced to async/await on the otherside. Building this out gave me a good foundation in understanding asynchrounous programming and how JavaScript works with it.  I also learned to fetch data and then to use data, which took me into API documentation and finally understanding what I was reading and then applying it. 

This project taught me:
- Asynchrounous Programming
- async/await
- Fetch
- API usage
- Media Queries (mostly because I wanted to show this off to my mom and I knew she was only going to look at it on her phone)
